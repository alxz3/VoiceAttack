# VoiceAttack
 
This is a community Voice Attack Server Profile that works with the DDCS server.
Please review the commands to see how they are prounounced and utilized.

You can Import or Duplicate this profile wherever you store your Voice Attack profile.

It is set up for AMERICAN English syle keyboards, you will have to customize any additional commands with regards to your localization. 
It may or may not work with all accents, you may have to customize some of the pronuncitations as well.
It is important to train your computer's voice profile to properly understand and utilize VoiceAttack well.
Start-->Settings-->Time & Language-->
Under Microphone, select the Get started button.

This profile is still a work in progress please check back often to see if commands have been changed/implemented. I will try to keep it up to date with the DDCS and DCS menus.
